            <p>
                My goal is to become a senior full-stack developer. Priority is given to work, development and family. My
                strengths: responsibility, mathematical mindset. I worked in the educational center as a teacher of mathematics
                and physics. At the moment I work as an engineer in the department of network operation and data transmission.
                The next goal is to go into the field of programming. I strive to travel and learn new things.
